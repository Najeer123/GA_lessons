# GA application

This python project was made for the purpose of completing the GA application assignment.

## Installation

This project was done on atom within the anaconda environment.

* [https://atom.io/] - atom 1.40.1
* [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section] - Anaconda 2019.07

After installation of atom and anaconda, open atom within the anaconda environment by opening the anaconda powershell and typing:

atom --new-instance

I chose to use Hydrogen to display graphs in atom, instead of the Jupyter Notebook, since that was what I was most comfortable with. The default keys to run Hydrogen in atom is shift + enter on highlighted code.
